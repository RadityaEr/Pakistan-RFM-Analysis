This is my personal project to learn how to Analyze a Dataset and build a dashboard in Power BI. The dataset is acquired from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zusmani/pakistans-largest-ecommerce-dataset/data).
.It records information on e-commerce transactions from 2016 to 2018 made at multiple marketplaces in Pakistan. It consists of various tables with the following is the one that I will use for the project:

The data preprocessing steps are done in python using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13EbynGYYMDx-SxP2p8X4cWS93u99zDcj?authuser=1). Unfortunately, I don't have any Microsoft organization account so I can only export my dashboard into a 
[PDF file](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1hrzrX24RYKQ1vnjDtF6s_hJcneebijny), which is also embedded in this repository

# Data Pre-Processing
Before constructing the Power BI dashboard, I first analyzed and cleaned the dataset to ensure data integrity and gain deeper insightsâ€”both from a technical and business perspective. 
This involved handling missing values, removing duplicates, and understanding each columnâ€™s significance and dropping irrelevant columns. The cleaned dataset is stored as .csv files in the data folder as Clean_Pakistan.csv
- Changing CustomerID into Text and Created_at into Date and Time.
- Organizing Order Status into Groups that means the same thing.
- Duplicate rows across the dataset were identified and removed
- Removing Negative Values in Qty Ordered and Discount, as well as removing Future Dates.
